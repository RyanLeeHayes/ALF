These G_imp values are subtracted from the free energy profiles before
flattening. This is done because the implicit constraints focus sampling
on the alchemical endpoints without adding barriers in alchemical space,
and we desire to preserve this feature rather than flatten it out too.

This directory contains the free energy for the implicit constraints (in
units of kT) under standard conditions so that the casual user does not
need to calculate it, and these values are used by default, unless the
user passes the path for another G_imp directory to runflat and
postprocess.

The standard conditions under which the free energy of the implicit
constraints were calculated was for 2-10 substituents with the standard
implicit constraint fnex value of 5.5. If you have more than 10
substituents, or if you add a barrier to increase your fraction physical
ligand, or raise fnex to increase fraction physical ligand, or do
anything else to perturb the sampling distribution you are targeting in
a "flat" landscape, you will need to recalculate these G_imp values
yourself in a new directory and pass the appropriate path to runflat and
postprocess.
