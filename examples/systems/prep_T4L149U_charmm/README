T4L149U_charmm - this runs the unfolded side of point mutations to site 149 in T4 lysozyme. Example scripts of how to use ALF are provided. Edit the first few lines of runset2.sh, runset4.sh, and postprocess.sh to set up the environment to run ALF and CHARMM. In particular, make sure CHARMMEXE is set, and that the setupenv script created during installation are sourced. These scripts can then be submitted to slurm with scripts like subset2.sh, subset4.sh, and subsetP.sh. runset2.sh performs flattening, which optimizes biasing potentials before production simulations. This is almost always necessary to get any results at all. After flattening, runset4.sh runs production simulations. Finally, postprocess.sh evaluates free energy using a histogram based estimator.
